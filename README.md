# Generic_torquer - NOS3 cFS Application

This repository contains the NOS3 Generic_torquer cFS application.

## Overview

Torquers, or magnetorquers, are commonly used on spacecraft as a secondary attitude 
control mechanism. They consist of electromagnets placed asymmetrically. Different 
currents running through them then generate different magnetic fields, and the 
torque created by the interaction of the spacecraft magnetic field and the Earthâ€™s 
magnetic field rotates the vehicle. Because of the small amounts of torque 
available, magnetorquers are only infrequently used as the primary attitude control 
mechanism; they frequently serve as a secondary mechanism, though, and are used to 
provide small rotational changes or to gradually unload reaction wheels. 

The example assumes a UART based device that.  This example can be used
with the generic_torquer simulator to show a device that is either synchronous or
asynchronous (i.e. can stream data).  The generic_torquer shows how to maintain
and report application status, how to maintain and report device status,
and how to automatically or on command send device data.  When showing
device streaming, the streaming rate can be commanded.

## Documentation
Currently support exists for the following versions:
* [cFS 6.7/6.8](https://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

# Commanding
Refer to the file `fsw/platform_inc/generic_torquer_app_msgids.h` for the Generic_torquer app message IDs
Refer to the file `fsw/src/generic_torquer_app_msg.h` for the Generic_torquer app command codes

The generic_torquer is relatively simple in outline; it takes as input only a value
for the current (in amperes) and returns a value for the magnetic field generated.

*it is possible that we will need to provide more calculation/return values than just
*a magnetic field; if so, there might need to be additional facts about the location or
*arrangement of the magnetorquers and such.

## Versioning
We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository.
